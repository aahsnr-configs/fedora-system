## Initial Setup

### Prerequisites

On your Fedora 42 host, install `distrobox` and `podman`.

```bash
# Install distrobox and podman
sudo dnf install distrobox podman
```

### Create and Enter the Container

```bash
# Create an Arch Linux container
distrobox create --name arch-desktop --image archlinux:latest

# Enter the container
distrobox enter arch-desktop
```

### Initial Container Configuration

Once inside the Arch container, update the system and install essential packages for GUI applications.

```bash
# Update package repositories and system
sudo pacman -Syu

# Install tools for GUI, theming, and fonts
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm --needed \
  xorg-xauth wayland \
  gtk3 gtk4 qt5-base qt6-base \

## Unified Theming (GTK & Qt)

To ensure both GTK and Qt applications have a consistent look and feel that matches your Fedora host, create a single script inside the container to sync theme settings.

### Create a Universal Theme Sync Script

This script reads your host's GTK theme settings and applies them to GTK and Qt applications within the container.

```bash
# In the Arch container, create the script
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
cat > ~/.local/bin/sync-theme.sh << 'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# 1. Read GTK settings from the host system
# Suppress errors in case the gsettings keys are not available
HOST_THEME=$(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme 2>/dev/null | tr -d "'")
HOST_ICON_THEME=$(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme 2>/dev/null | tr -d "'")
HOST_FONT=$(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface font-name 2>/dev/null | tr -d "'")
HOST_CURSOR_THEME=$(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme 2>/dev/null | tr -d "'")

# Exit if host theme could not be determined
if [ -z "$HOST_THEME" ]; then
    echo "Could not determine host theme. Exiting."
    exit 1
fi

# 2. Apply settings to GTK apps in the container
# Apply via gsettings (for modern apps)
if command -v gsettings &> /dev/null; then
    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme "$HOST_THEME"
    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme "$HOST_ICON_THEME"
    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface font-name "$HOST_FONT"
    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme "$HOST_CURSOR_THEME"
fi

# Apply via config files for GTK3
mkdir -p ~/.config/gtk-3.0
cat > ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini << EOL
[Settings]
gtk-theme-name=$HOST_THEME
gtk-icon-theme-name=$HOST_ICON_THEME
gtk-font-name=$HOST_FONT
gtk-cursor-theme-name=$HOST_CURSOR_THEME
EOL

# Apply via config files for GTK4
mkdir -p ~/.config/gtk-4.0
cat > ~/.config/gtk-4.0/settings.ini << EOL
[Settings]
gtk-theme-name=$HOST_THEME
gtk-icon-theme-name=$HOST_ICON_THEME
gtk-font-name=$HOST_FONT
gtk-cursor-theme-name=$HOST_CURSOR_THEME
EOL

# 3. Configure Qt apps to follow the GTK theme
# Set the platform theme environment variables
cat > ~/.config/environment.d/10-qt-theme.conf << EOL
QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct
EOL

# Configure qt5ct and qt6ct to use the 'gtk2' style
mkdir -p ~/.config/qt5ct ~/.config/qt6ct
cat > ~/.config/qt5ct/qt5ct.conf << EOL
[Appearance]
style=gtk2
icon_theme=$HOST_ICON_THEME
EOL
cp ~/.config/qt5ct/qt5ct.conf ~/.config/qt6ct/qt6ct.conf

echo "Theme ($HOST_THEME) and icons ($HOST_ICON_THEME) synced successfully."
EOF

# Make the script executable
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/sync-theme.sh

# Run the script for the first time
~/.local/bin/sync-theme.sh
```

## Application Scaling

This section covers scaling for HiDPI displays.

### Create a Scaling Setup Script

This script detects the host's text scaling factor and applies it within the container.

```bash
# In the Arch container, create the script
cat > ~/.local/bin/setup-scaling.sh << 'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Read the host's text scaling factor (default to 1.0 if not set)
HOST_TEXT_SCALE=$(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface text-scaling-factor 2>/dev/null || echo 1.0)
SCALE_FACTOR=${HOST_TEXT_SCALE:-1.0}

# Define environment variables for GTK, Qt, and X11
cat > ~/.config/environment.d/20-scaling.conf << EOL
# GTK Scaling
GDK_SCALE=$SCALE_FACTOR
GDK_DPI_SCALE=$(echo "1.0 / $SCALE_FACTOR" | bc)

# Qt Scaling
QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=0
QT_SCALE_FACTOR=$SCALE_FACTOR

# X11 Scaling (for legacy apps)
XCURSOR_SIZE=$((24 * SCALE_FACTOR))
EOL

echo "Scaling configured for factor: $SCALE_FACTOR"
EOF

# Make the script executable
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/setup-scaling.sh

# Run the script for the first time
~/.local/bin/setup-scaling.sh
```

**Note:** For this to take effect, you may need to exit and re-enter the container.

## SELinux Policies

To allow the container to function correctly without disabling SELinux on the host, follow these steps on your **Fedora 42 host**.

### 1. Install SELinux Development Tools

```bash
# On the Fedora host
sudo dnf install policycoreutils-python-utils setools-console selinux-policy-devel udica
```

### 2. Generate a Container-Specific Policy with Udica

Udica generates a tailored SELinux policy by inspecting a running container, providing the most secure and accurate rules.

```bash
# On the Fedora host
# First, find your container's full ID
CONTAINER_ID=$(podman ps -q --filter "name=arch-desktop")

# Check if the container is running
if [ -z "$CONTAINER_ID" ]; then
  echo "Container 'arch-desktop' is not running. Please start it first."
  exit 1
fi

# Generate the SELinux policy
sudo udica -j $CONTAINER_ID distrobox_arch_policy

# This creates a policy file named distrobox_arch_policy.cil
```

### 3. Compile and Install the Policy

```bash
# On the Fedora host
# Install the generated policy
sudo semodule -i distrobox_arch_policy.cil

# Optionally, you can make this policy permissive to debug issues
# sudo semanage permissive -a container_t

# Verify the new module is active
sudo semodule -l | grep distrobox
```

### 4. Apply Correct SELinux Labels

Ensure the files used by Distrobox have the correct SELinux context.

```bash
# On the Fedora host
# Label the container storage directory
sudo semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t "$HOME/.local/share/containers(/.*)?"
sudo restorecon -R -v "$HOME/.local/share/containers"

# Label the distrobox configuration directory
sudo semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t "$HOME/.local/share/distrobox(/.*)?"
sudo restorecon -R -v "$HOME/.local/share/distrobox"
```

### 5. Monitor and Debug SELinux Denials

If applications fail to launch or behave incorrectly, check for SELinux denials.

```bash
# On the Fedora host
# Search for recent denials related to containers
sudo ausearch -m avc -ts recent | grep "comm=\"podman\""

# For more detailed analysis, use sealert
sudo sealert -a /var/log/audit/audit.log
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Container Initialization

To automate setup, create an `init` hook for your container. This will run your scripts every time you enter it.

In your `~/.distrobox/distrobox.conf` file on the host, add the following lines:

```ini
[container_hooks]
arch-desktop.pre-init="~/.local/bin/sync-theme.sh && ~/.local/bin/setup-scaling.sh"
```

### 2. Application Desktop Files

Use `distrobox-export` to automatically create `.desktop` files on your host for applications installed in the container.

```bash
# Inside the Arch container
# Export an application (e.g., vlc)
distrobox-export --app vlc
```

This command creates a launcher in `~/.local/share/applications` on your host that correctly executes the application from the container.

### 3. Font Management

To use your host's fonts inside the container, create a symbolic link.

```bash
# Inside the Arch container
mkdir -p ~/.fonts
ln -s /usr/share/fonts ~/.fonts/host-fonts
fc-cache -f -v
```

### 4. Container Management Script

For convenience, create a management script on your **Fedora host**.

```bash
# On the Fedora host
cat > ~/.local/bin/manage-distrobox.sh << 'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env bash

CONTAINER_NAME="arch-desktop"

case "$1" in
    start)
        echo "Entering container..."
        distrobox enter $CONTAINER_NAME
        ;;
    update)
        echo "Updating container..."
        distrobox enter $CONTAINER_NAME -- sudo pacman -Syu
        ;;
    selinux-regen)
        echo "Regenerating SELinux policy..."
        CONTAINER_ID=$(podman ps -q --filter "name=$CONTAINER_NAME")
        if [ -n "$CONTAINER_ID" ]; then
            sudo udica -j $CONTAINER_ID ${CONTAINER_NAME}_policy && \
            sudo semodule -i ${CONTAINER_NAME}_policy.cil
        else
            echo "Container '$CONTAINER_NAME' is not running."
        fi
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Usage: $0 {start|update|selinux-regen}"
        exit 1
        ;;
esac
EOF

chmod +x ~/.local/bin/manage-distrobox.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

#### Theme Not Applied Correctly

1.  **Re-run the script**: `distrobox enter arch-desktop -- ~/.local/bin/sync-theme.sh`
2.  **Check Environment Variables**: Inside the container, run `env | grep QT_`. You should see `QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct`.
3.  **Install Missing Theme Engine**: The container may need a specific GTK theme engine (e.g., `murrine`) that is not installed.

#### Scaling Issues

1.  **Verify Variables**: Inside the container, run `env | grep -E "GDK_SCALE|QT_SCALE_FACTOR"`.
2.  **Restart Applications**: Scaling variables are typically read on application startup. Close and reopen the application.
3.  **Exit and Re-enter**: Exit the container and enter it again to ensure the `environment.d` files are sourced.

#### SELinux Denials

1.  **Check Audit Log**: `sudo ausearch -m avc -ts recent | audit2allow -a`. This command will show you the denial and suggest a potential fix.
2.  **Use Permissive Mode for Debugging**: If you cannot resolve the issue, you can temporarily set the container context to permissive: `sudo semanage permissive -a container_t`. **This is not a permanent solution.**
3.  **Regenerate Policy**: After installing a new application that accesses host resources differently, regenerate the Udica policy.

### Summary of Fixes and Changes

1.  **Redundancy in Theming:**
    - The separate `sync-gtk-theme.sh` and `apply-unified-theme.sh` scripts were redundant and contradictory. They were merged into a single `sync-theme.sh` script.
    - The hardcoded Qt configuration was replaced with a dynamic method that sets the Qt style to `gtk2`, forcing Qt to follow the GTK theme automatically. This is a much more robust and maintainable approach.
    - Removed the redundant `QT_STYLE_OVERRIDE` environment variable.

2.  **Improved Scripting Logic:**
    - Scripts now use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` for better portability.
    - Added checks to ensure scripts exit gracefully if a required setting (like a host theme) cannot be found.
    - Environment variables are now set using `~/.config/environment.d/` files inside the container, which is the modern, systemd-recommended way for user sessions. This avoids cluttering shell-specific files like `.bashrc`.

3.  **Simplification and Accuracy:**
    - The `pacman` command in the initial setup was consolidated using `--noconfirm` and `--needed` to be more efficient.
    - Removed the `xorg-server-xephyr` package, as it's not needed for running applications and adds unnecessary complexity.
    - Added the `gsettings-desktop-schemas` package, which is often required for `gsettings` to work correctly.

4.  **SELinux Section Overhaul:**
    - The guide now strongly recommends **Udica** as the primary method for generating SELinux policies, which is safer and more accurate than writing manual rules.
    - The complex and potentially insecure manual `.te` file has been removed in favor of the automated Udica workflow.
    - Simplified the SELinux commands and added checks to ensure the container is running before generating a policy.
    - Removed unnecessary `setsebool` commands that are not relevant for a standard desktop setup.

5.  **Enhanced Best Practices:**
    - Instead of sourcing scripts from `.bashrc`, the guide now recommends using Distrobox's built-in `pre-init` hook for a more reliable and shell-agnostic initialization process.
    - Replaced instructions for manually creating `.desktop` files with the much simpler and more robust `distrobox-export` command.
    - The container management script was simplified to focus on the most common and useful tasks.
