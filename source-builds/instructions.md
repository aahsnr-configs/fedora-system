The task one is to write a new python3.13 that will 1st incorporate the above python script, so that it is 1st to run. Then make sure ~/.emacs.d/ and ~/.config/emacs directory don't exist. Then make sure emacs as a daemon or systemd user service is not running. Then add a feature to install zeromq-devel using dnf. Then git clone my personal emacs configuration using the command 'git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:aahsnr/emacs.git ~/.config/emacs' Then incorporate the attached emacs-log.txt bash script that would be turned into a python script. Therefore the goal is to completely setup a emacs distribution from scratch starting building emacs from source. Make sure the new script has all features and best practices from the previous output. Keep in mind that the home directory for emacs configuration will always be ~/.config/emacs
