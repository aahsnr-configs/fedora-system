# Security Enhancements for a secure user service
# For user services, ProtectHome=true allows the service's own user to write to their home directory.
# This is crucial for applications that need to write configuration or logs to ~/.config or ~/.local/share.
PrivateTmp=true               # Isolate temporary directories for the service
ProtectSystem=full            # Make /usr, /boot, /etc read-only for the service
ProtectHome=true              # Make user's home directory read-only for others, but writable for the service's user
NoNewPrivileges=true          # Prevent the service from gaining new privileges
RestrictRealtime=true         # Prevent real-time scheduling
SystemCallFilter=@system-service # Restrict system calls to a safe set for general system services
CapabilityBoundingSet=        # Remove all capabilities (e.g., CAP_NET_RAW)
AmbientCapabilities=          # No ambient capabilities
MemoryDenyWriteExecute=true   # Prevent writing to and executing from memory
